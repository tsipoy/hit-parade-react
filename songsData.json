            I can almost see it
            That dream I'm dreaming but
            There's a voice inside my head saying
            You'll never reach it,
            Every step I'm taking,
            Every move I make feels
            Lost with no direction
            My faith is shaking but I
            Gotta keep trying
            Gotta keep my head held high
            There's always gonna be another mountain
            I'm always gonna wanna make it move
            Always gonna be an uphill battle
            Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
            Ain't about how fast I get there
            Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
            It's the climb
            The struggles I'm facing
            The chances I'm taking
            Sometimes might knock me down but
            No I'm not breaking
            I may not know it
            But these are the moments that
            I'm going to remember most yeah
            Just got to keep going
            And I
            I gotta be strong
            Just keep pushing on, 'cause
            There's always gonna be another…

            When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
            What a glory He sheds on our way!
            While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
            And with all who will trust and obey.
            Trust and obey, for there's no other way
            To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
            Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,
            But His smile quickly drives it away;
            Not a doubt or a fear, not a sigh or a tear,
            Can abide while we trust and obey.
            Trust and obey, for there's no other way
            To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
            Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet.
            Or we'll walk by His side in the way.
            What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;
            Never fear, only trust and obey.
            Trust and obey, for there's no other way
            To be happy in Jesus, but to trust…

            Baby, I know the story
            I've seen the picture
            It's written all over your face
            Tell me, what's the secret that you've been hiding?
            And who's gonna take my place?
            I should have seen it coming
            I should have read the signs
            Anyway, I guess it's over
            Can't believe that I'm a fool again
            I thought this love would never end
            How was I to know?
            You never told me
            Can't believe that I'm a fool again
            And I who thought you were my friend
            How was I to know?
            You never told me
            Baby, you should've called me
            When you were lonely
            When you needed me to be there
            Sadly, you never gave me
            Too many chances to show you
            How much I care
            Ooh, should have seen it coming
            I should have read the signs
            Anyway, I guess it's over
            Can't believe that I'm a fool again

            Well you only need the light when it's burning low
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
            Only know you love her when you let her go
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
            Only hate the road when you're missing home
            Only know you love her when you let her go
            And you let her go
            Staring at the bottom of your glass
            Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
            But dreams come slow and they go so fast
            You see her when you close your eyes
            Maybe one day you'll understand why
            Everything you touch surely dies
            'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
            Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
            Only know you love her when you let her go
            Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
            Only hate the road when you're missing home
            Only know you love…

            I just drift away

            You've set my heart on fire
            Filled me with love
            Made me a woman on clouds above
            I couldn't get much higher
            My spirit takes flight

            I am alive

            God knows that
            That I'll be the one
            Standing by
